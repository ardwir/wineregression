# Wine Quality Regression

Dataset source: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality

### The objective of this code is to use regression model for wine dataset to predict the quality of wine using pyysicochemical test data:
  1. fixed acidity
  2. volatile acidity
  3. citric acid
  4. residual sugar
  5. chlorides
  6. free sulfur dioxide
  7. total sulfur dioxide
  8. density
  9. pH
  10. sulphates
  11. alcohol 
  
### We use two model:
  1. Linear Regression
  2. Logistic Regression
